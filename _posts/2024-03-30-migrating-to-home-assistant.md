description: Automation and privacy in a single place
---

A few weeks ago, a friend reminded me of the simplicity and capacity of [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) as a home automation framework. While I'm not reticent to changes, most of my home automation goes through [Apple HomeKit](https://www.apple.com/home-app/), and I'm somewhat happy with it. However, HomeKit leans on the basic side. Let's dive into a better and more privacy-aware solution for your home automation!

The last weekend, I put my hands on this new project and installed a [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) Virtual Machine in my [home server running Proxmox](https://blog.nico.ninja/my-home-server/). After reading the introductory guide to Home Assistant, I decided to go with the [alternative](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/alternative) installation method, which involves importing a virtual machine image into your preferred virtualization engine. Since I'm running Proxmox, I choose the qcow2 image format. The first step is to create a virtual machine with the "Do not use any media‚Äù option selected in the OS tab, 1vCPU, and 2GB of RAM. We'll feed the virtual machine with an already-backed OS image. Home Assistant provides this image compressed with `xz`, so you may want to decompress it and import it. Here are the three commands you need to install the virtual machine.


```bash
axel -n10 https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system/releases/download/12.2/haos_ova-12.2.qcow2.xz
xz -d haos_ova-12.2.qcow2.xz
qm importdisk 123 ./haos_ova-12.2.qcow2 local-lvm --format qcow2
```

Once started, the machine will get an IP address with DHCP, but you may want to configure a static IP address. Out of the box, the Home Assistant virtual machine doesn't have an SSH server enabled, but you can use the Proxmox console to throw commands in. Once brought up, you can access the HA web console at `http://homeassistant.local:8123/`

![HA web view](/assets/images/home-assistant-1/ha-web-view.png)


One of the first things you may want to do is install a File Editor to edit the HA configuration files inside your browser. As I'm using a reverse proxy for SSL and custom domains, I had to enable the X-Forwarded-For header and make HA aware of the reverse proxy. That was as simple as editing the `configuration.yaml` file and add the following block:

```yaml
http:
  use_x_forwarded_for: true
  trusted_proxies:
    - 192.168.1.112
```

While I found HA quite powerful at the moment, I didn't realize how good it was until I tried [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/index.html). [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/index.html) compiles and burns custom firmware for ESP8266 and ESP32 devices to make them talk the Home Assistant protocol and then integrate them into your dashboard. 

![CO2 concentration plot over time](/assets/images/home-assistant-1/co2-concentration-plot.png)


This was mind-blowing. First, I picked one Firebeetle ESP8266 from the drawer and started playing around. In HA, I had to install the [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/index.html) add-on from the add-ons menu and then, from the [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/index.html) menu, install the custom firmware into my ESP8266 directly from the browser to the MCU with a USB cable. Incredible. Then, as I couldn't wait to try it, I hooked an [SSD1306 128x64 pixels OLED screen](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/SSD1306.pdf) to the ESP8266 and [an analog CO2 sensor](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Gravity__Infrared_CO2_Sensor_For_Arduino_SKU__SEN0219). With this little code written into the ESP8266, I got an actual measure of CO2 concentration in my Home Assistant dashboard and the OLED screen updated on each sensor refresh, which is astonishing.

 

```yaml

      int width = GetTextWidth(&it, id(font1), "%0.f", id(co2_sensor).state);
      it.printf((128-width)/2, 0, id(font1), "%0.f", id(co2_sensor).state);
      width = GetTextWidth(&it, id(font2), "%s", "ppm");
      it.printf((128-width)/2, 45, id(font2), "ppm");

      - lambda: |-
          if (x == 0) {
            ESP_LOGW("custom", "Error: Sensor reading is 0");
          } else if (x < 0.4) {
            ESP_LOGW("custom", "Pre-heating sensor");
          } else {
            float voltageDifference = x - 0.4;
            float concentration = (voltageDifference * 4600.0) / 1.6;
            ESP_LOGW("custom", "Volts measured: %f. CO2 Concentration: %f", x, concentration);
            return concentration;
          }
          return 0;
    on_value: 
      then:
        - component.update: oled_display
            
```

Once coded, the same IDE warns and throws errors if you make any mistakes. If the code is clean enough, you can directly compile and upload it from the web browser wirelessly (yeah, as you've read, there are no wires to program the microcontroller).

You can even use custom fonts in a very simple way, even more, you can import standard C header files as I did with the `text_utils.h` there. `text_utils.h` was developed by Samuel Gundel, [as seen in the Home Assistant community](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/centering-text-when-using-multiple-printf/491205/14). It exposes a `GetTextWidth` method that is quite useful when printing data on screens and you want it to be centered. Here's the `text_utils.h` complete code:

```c
int GetTextBounds(esphome::display::Display* it, esphome::font::Font *font, const char *buffer)
{
    int x1 = 0;     // A pointer to store the returned x coordinate of the upper left corner in. 
    int y1 = 0;     // A pointer to store the returned y coordinate of the upper left corner in.
    int width = 0;  // A pointer to store the returned text width in.
    int height = 0; // A pointer to store the returned text height in. 
    it->get_text_bounds(0, 0, buffer, font, TextAlign::TOP_LEFT, &x1, &y1, &width, &height);
    return width;
}

int GetTextWidth(esphome::display::Display* it, esphome::font::Font *font, const char* formatting, const char *raw_text){
    char temp_buffer[80];
    sprintf(temp_buffer, formatting, raw_text);
    return GetTextBounds(it, font, temp_buffer);
}

int GetTextWidth(esphome::display::Display* it, esphome::font::Font *font, const char* formatting, const int raw_int){
    char temp_buffer[80];
    sprintf(temp_buffer, formatting, raw_int);
    return GetTextBounds(it, font, temp_buffer);
}

int GetTextWidth(esphome::display::Display* it, esphome::font::Font *font, const char* formatting, const float raw_float){
    char temp_buffer[80];
    sprintf(temp_buffer, formatting, raw_float);
    return GetTextBounds(it, font, temp_buffer);
}

// Calculate the width of time format
int GetTextWidth(esphome::display::Display* it, esphome::font::Font *font, const char* formatting, esphome::ESPTime time){
    auto c_tm = time.to_c_tm();
    size_t buffer_length = 80;
    char temp_buffer[buffer_length];
    strftime(temp_buffer, buffer_length, formatting, &c_tm);
    return GetTextBounds(it, font, temp_buffer);
}
```

Remember my [kill-switch project for the 3D printer](https://blog.nico.ninja/3d-printer-remote-shutdown/)? It's nonsense to code and set up a static IP address in the box, mess with your browser when entering the host and the port, and code the HTML.

With Home Assistant and [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/index.html), it is as easy as a few lines of YAML. The only drawback here is that as I was using an ESP-01 microcontroller, I had no luck getting it into bootloader mode. Fortunately, ESPHome can compile the code and give you the `.bin` file to upload through the esptool's command-line interface. See how small the code is; it does exactly the same as my long spaghetti code. I love it.

```yaml
esphome:
  name: 3d-printer-power
  friendly_name: 3d-printer-power
  on_boot: 
    - priority: 90
      then: 
      - switch.turn_on: output_high

esp8266:
  board: esp01_1m

switch:
  - platform: gpio
    name: "3D Printer Power"
    pin: 2
    inverted: false
    id: output_high
```

I plan to migrate my entire automation stack to Home Assistant. The complicated stuff may live in [the air conditioner remote control for Apple's HomeKit protocol](https://blog.nico.ninja/controlling-ac-units-apple-home/).
