description: Building a 4-channel power meter for my apartment
---

I've been investigating those generic WiFi AC power meters for the last few months, [like this one](https://www.ebay.com/itm/385331989345). I'm not entirely happy about connecting third-party stuff to my local network. Even though I have a separate VLAN for IoT, it's weird to install someone else's hardware with god knows what kind of software it runs. So, I decided to build my power meter. 

![Testing the PCB](/assets/images/ac-current-meter-1/pcb-testing-header.jpg)


Things to take into account:
* I need a 220V AC power meter.
* I want to measure 4 AC lines simultaneously (air conditioner line, oven, lights, and power outlets).
* I need it to export Prometheus metrics for my monitoring system.
* I want a screen so I can peek at it during the day.
* Ideally, I want to keep the AC wiring, so a non-invasive sensor is encouraged.

# Sensors
Digging around the Internet, I found the [SCT-013 split-core current transformers](/assets/files/ac-current-meter-1/sct-013-datasheet.pdf). These are cheap, easy to install, and interestingly precise and reliable. More importantly, as they are split-core, I don't need to modify the distribution panel wiring to install them. The SCT-013s come in different ratings. I chose the SCT-013-020, which has a 20A input and 1V output, built-in load resistance, and 1% accuracy and linearity. Beware that the sensors have a flow direction arrow printed over the clamp!

# Reading and conditioning the signals
I want to export Prometheus metrics from these sensors, so I chose a Wemos D1 ESP8266 microcontroller. The ESP8266 has only one analog input, so analog-to-digital conversion is also required. The [ADS1115](https://www.ti.com/product/ADS1115) will be our ADC, and we will benefit from its excellent stability and precision when converting voltages.

![Measurements](/assets/images/ac-current-meter-1/measuring-1.jpg)


But there's a problem! The SCT-013 clamps are just a transformer, so we get a 1V AC voltage at their outputs. AC voltages are not easily measurable with a microcontroller due to the nature of AC: the sine wave goes from -1V to +1V in a 50Hz period (for Argentina). While we could use two inputs of the [ADS1115](https://www.ti.com/product/ADS1115) for each SCT-013 and then measure the differential peak tension between the two inputs, I prefer an external signal conditioner using op-amps.

Digging into my drawers, I found a few [LM358s](https://www.ti.com/product/LM358), including a dual op-amp chip. Perfect. I will use the op-amp as an [inverting operational amplifier](https://www.monolithicpower.com/en/operational-amplifiers); this way, we eliminate the negative part of the AC sine. If you have an [LM324](https://www.ti.com/product/LM324) lying around, you need one chip as a signal conditioner for four SCT-013 clamps, as the [LM324](https://www.ti.com/product/LM324) is a quad op-amp chip. Here's the full [schematic](/assets/files/ac-current-meter-1/schematic.pdf).

![LM358 settings](/assets/images/ac-current-meter-1/op-amp-settings.png)

In this configuration, the op-amp will output only the positive part of the sine, so we will need to sample a couple of readings and then register the maximums of the sine.

![LM358 settings](/assets/images/ac-current-meter-1/op-amp-sim.png)

The [ADS1115](https://www.ti.com/product/ADS1115) has two configurations: The I2C address, which, in my case, will be set to `0x48` by pulling down the `ADDR` pin to the ground. Then there is the gain configuration; as I don't need mega precision, I set it to `GAIN_TWO`, which reads `+/â€”2.048V` with a precision of 0.0625mV per value in 16 bits.

![PCB Done](/assets/images/ac-current-meter-1/pcb-done-up.jpg)

To average the readings and get a more stable output, I am reading around 30 cycles at 50Hz; hence, `SAMPLING_DURATION_MS` is set to 600ms. We read the ADC value from the [ADS1115](https://www.ti.com/product/ADS1115) input on each loop pass and then convert it to the actual DC voltage `computeVolts` built-in function. The voltage is multiplied by the sensor current (20 for my 20A clamps), and then we keep the peak readings for both minimums and maximums. Then, we need to do the sum of the squares to represent the actual AC amplitude. The resultant value is then squared to compensate for the negative half cycles of the AC. The RMS voltage is calculated with the `sqrt` function using the averaged readings as the value. The same procedure is repeated for each clamp. Here's a screenshot of the oscilloscope measuring ~2.1 Amps AC at the [ADS1115](https://www.ti.com/product/ADS1115) input.

![Hantek load measurements](/assets/images/ac-current-meter-1/hantek-measurements.png)

The oscilloscope measured ~207 mVpp of DC. Since our op-amp is configured as an inverting amplifier, the math is `vOut = -(R2/R1) * vIn`. My SCT-013s are 20A/1V so we can easily calculate the current of 207 mVpp as `sqrt(0.207 * 20) = 2.034 Amps`.


# Displaying values
It would be helpful to have a display that informs the current values of each clamp and the sum of all readings in watts and ampere inside the distribution box. As I already used the I2C protocol for the [ADS1115](https://www.ti.com/product/ADS1115), I added a 0.96" OLED screen. The values change from ampere to watts on each loop iteration and vice-versa.

![Display working](/assets/images/ac-current-meter-1/display-working.jpg)

The display is configured to show the IP address when connected to the WiFi (during startup) and then to cycle between ampere and watts measurements. The first four lines correspond to each SCT-013 input, and the final reading is the sum of each measurement.


# Prometheus exporter
I also wanted to keep track of the power usage in my existing Prometheus + Grafana stack. As I already deployed a Prometheus Pushgateway endpoint, this is as easy as pushing the metrics. Then, in Grafana, I can do the needed calculations, such as calculating the monthly energy spend.

```
# HELP line_current_amps Current (amps) flowing through a voltage line
# TYPE line_current_amps gauge
line_current_amps{line="line_0"} 4.32
line_current_amps{line="line_1"} 1.23
line_current_amps{line="line_2"} 0.01
line_current_amps{line="line_3"} 0.03
```

# 3D printed case
I built a case that fits the whole 90 x 70 mm PCB. You slide in the PCB and use the stereo jack nuts to fasten the prototype. There's also an aperture for the Wemos D1 USB port, just for debugging purposes. The case also has an open rectangle where you can connect the OLED display. In the back, there's a DIN rail-sized support to hang the case inside the distribution box.
